# BeatSaberSongBrowser
A plugin for customizing the in-game song browser.

*This mod works on both the Steam and Oculus Store versions.*

## Status
- Only tested happy paths so far.

### Known Issues
- Original sorting method (what you normally get with just SongLoaderPluging) is not working

## Usage
- This adds three sorting methods to the Song Browser:
  - Default, this is `authorName` then `songName`.
  - Favorite, this is anything marked favorite first followed by the default.
  - Original, an attempt to match the original sorting (broken).
- To mark a song as a favorite there is a +1/-1 button added to the song detail view.
