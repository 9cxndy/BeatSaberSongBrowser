# BeatSaberSongBrowser
A plugin for customizing the in-game song browser.

- Marking a song as favorite
- Currently supports these sorting methods:
  - Default: `authorName` then `songName`.
  - Favorite: Anything marked favorite followed by the Default method.
  - Original: Match the original sorting you would normally get after SongLoaderPlugin.
- Clicking a sorting method will resort the song list immediately.

## Status
- Working!
- Known Issues:
 - Massive custom song collections seem to be causing issues.

### Known Issues
